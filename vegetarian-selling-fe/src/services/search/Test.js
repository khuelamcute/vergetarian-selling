      The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse[1] are figures in the Christian
      religion, first appearing in Revelation, an apocalypse written by John of
      Patmos. Revelation 6 tells of a book or scroll in God's right hand that is
      sealed with seven seals. The Lamb of God/Lion of Judah opens the first
      four of the seven seals, which summons four beings that ride out on white,
      red, black, and pale horses. In John's revelation, the first horseman
      rides on a white horse, carries a bow, and is given a crown â€“ he rides
      forward as a figure of Conquest,[2][3] perhaps invoking Pestilence,
      Christ, or the Antichrist. The second carries a sword and rides a red
      horse and is the creator of (civil) War, conflict and strife.[4] The
      third, a food-merchant riding upon a black horse, symbolizes Famine. He
      carries The Scales.[5] The fourth and final horse is pale, and upon it
      rides Death, accompanied by Hades.[6] "They were given authority over a
      quarter of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, and plague, and by means
      of the beasts of the earth."[7] Apocalyptic Christianity sometimes
      interprets the Four Horsemen as a vision of harbingers of the Last
      Judgment, setting a divine end-time upon the world.[8][9]
